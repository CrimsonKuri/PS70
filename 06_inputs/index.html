<h3>Week 6: Electronic Inputs</h3>

<h4>Assignment 1: Capactive Sensor</h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

An Update! The following is the program used to set up the capacative sensor, with a visit to the workshop necessary for some remaining parts.

<h4>Assignment 2: [Use + Calibrate Another Sensor]</h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

I'm most interested in making use of an electromagnetic sensor, but I have some concepts to review before doing so.

<h4>Assignment 3: Schematics of Each Sensor</h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

Have not started, will also have to review concepts.

<h4>Assignment 4: Calibrate each sensor</h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

Have not started, will also have to review concepts.

<h4>Assignment 5: Plan for CNC assignment</h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

At its earliest, I initially planned to recreate a small model of a keyboard. This would involve using the revopoint scanner to scan a 3d model of a keyboard, before scaling it down to a size appropriate for the CNC machine. However, there were troubles scanning the keyboard due to its dark color, shiny finishes and flat shape. I was later recommended to focus on a something smaller, pivoting to a single keycap.
