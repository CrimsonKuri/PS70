<h3>Week 7: Electronic Outputs</h3>



<h4>Assignment: Minimum Viable Product for Final Project</h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

When I first began to approach my minimal viable product, I hoped to form the externals of my project. I will still include my initial brainstorm for the project's externals but then pivot to the appropriate preparation involved in the project's microcontroller code, and internals.

<p class = "margin"></p>

Early on in the process, I was interested in providing a non-traditional console shape, and decided that I would trial and model a shell for the console while reserving the space the microcontroller would need on the breadboard.

<p class = "margin"></p>

Since I was familiar with many consoles that were made of much more stable materials than cardboard but was intimidated by the prospect of cutting and assembling a material like acryllic, I was interested in making a 3d print. It would allow me to make the pieces fit together with little setup. I was also interested in making a snap fit lid in order to make a satisfying and stable removal of the top cover when working on the internals.

However, I transitioned to making a stable cover using the setup that I'd made for holding the breadboard. But while I was satisfied by the appearance of the box's model in Fusion, I was met with two problems. The first of the two was that the size of a hexagonal console made for an intimidating 3d print build, threatening a waste of filament and wasted time building the console's shell. The second was that it was heavily conditioned on a set of internals and the associated LED positions that I didn't have set in stone yet. 

<p class = "margin"></p>

In the end, I've pivoted focusing on the internals of the console, as well as the microcontroller's programming. That way I can determine what types of space I might want to reserve on the top of the console's shell for the LEDs and buttons. While I might form a prototype by preparing to arrange LEDs through a piece of paper, the final project may have to take form in the shape of a cardboard case, which I'm not opposed to now.

The following is significant progress in setting the relevant transitionary LED toggling at each step of the game. This alongside some simple randomness and simpler LED corner transitions should produce a polished game.
